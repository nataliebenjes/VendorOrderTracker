# Vendor Order Tracker

### By Natalie Benjes

## Description

 Pierre's bakery is expanding, and he needs a reliable way to track his vendors and their orders. To meet his requirements, I have built the "Vendor and Order Tracker" using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This web application will assist Pierre in managing his business relationships and orders efficiently.

## Technologies Used
1. C# and .NET Core

2. Razor: Razor syntax is used for the views, allowing seamless integration of C# code within HTML pages, creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

3. This application follows the MVC pattern, promoting separation of concerns and making it easier to manage and extend the codebase.

## Features
1. Homepage - Welcome Pierre: Upon accessing the application at the root path (localhost:5000/), Pierre will be greeted with a welcoming splash page. This page will provide him with a link to the Vendors page, where he can view and manage his vendors.

2. Vendors Page: This page will display a list of all registered vendors. For each vendor, Pierre will be able to click their name and navigate to a dedicated page that showcases all the orders associated with that particular vendor.

3. Create a New Vendor: On the Vendors page, Pierre will find a form to create a new vendor. When he fills out the necessary details and submits the form, a new Vendor object will be created and added to the list of vendors, enabling Pierre to keep track of all his business relationships.

4. Vendor Orders Page: When Pierre clicks on a vendor's name, he will be directed to a new page that displays all orders associated with that vendor. This view will help him monitor the orders placed by each vendor with ease.

5. Create a New Order: To add a new order for a specific vendor, Pierre can use the "Create New Order" form accessible via a link on the Vendor Orders page. The URL for this form will follow a pattern like "/vendors/1/orders/new", where "1" represents the vendor's unique ID.



## How To Run This Project

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/nataliebenjes/VendorOrderTracker/blob/master/VendorOrderTracker/models/Vendor.cs`
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory `cd vendor-order-tracker`. 
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).
